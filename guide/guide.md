I want to build a fully functionnal webapp destinned for hr agencies to help them treat candidates efficently and match them with job openings. The landing page will include logins for candidates and for their employees. Hr employyes will have access to the dashboard where they will see all the candidates and the subsequent analysis and all the feature described later. The landing page will also include a general application. The dashboard will consist of the twenty open sourced crm, tweaked  and adapted for supabase and vercel and our use case. twenty integration : https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty
**1. Understand the `twentyhq/twenty` Stack:**

*   **Backend:** NestJS (Node.js framework)
*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Caching/Queues:** Redis (used by BullMQ for background jobs)
*   **Architecture:** Monorepo managed with Nx.

**2. Assess Compatibility and Challenges:**

*   **Supabase (Database):** Good news! Supabase provides a PostgreSQL database, which matches Twenty's requirement. You'll need to:
    *   Get the connection string from your Supabase project.
    *   Configure the NestJS backend to use this connection string.
    *   Run Twenty's database migrations against your Supabase instance. You'll need to find how migrations are handled in the `twentyhq/twenty` project (often via scripts or ORM commands).
*   **Vercel Serverless Functions (Backend):**
    *   **NestJS:** Deploying NestJS on Vercel is possible, but requires specific configuration (`vercel.json`) to handle the framework correctly within the serverless environment. Search Vercel's documentation or community examples for NestJS deployment.
    *   **Statelessness:** Serverless functions are ideally stateless. Ensure the NestJS application doesn't rely on in-memory state or local file system storage that wouldn't persist between invocations.
    *   **Redis/BullMQ:** This is the trickiest part for a pure Vercel serverless setup.
        *   Serverless functions aren't designed to run persistent background queue workers like BullMQ typically requires.
        *   You'll likely need an external Redis provider that's accessible from Vercel functions (e.g., Upstash is a popular choice that integrates well).
        *   For running the *jobs* defined using BullMQ, you might need to trigger serverless functions via Vercel Cron Jobs or adapt the architecture significantly, potentially moving away from BullMQ if its pattern doesn't fit the serverless model well.
*   **Vercel (Frontend):** Deploying the React frontend to Vercel is straightforward and well-supported.
*   **"No External API Dependency":** This usually means you want to host the core CRM logic yourself, which using the open-source `twentyhq/twenty` achieves. You still rely on infrastructure APIs (Vercel, Supabase, potentially a Redis provider). You should verify if any *core* CRM features within Twenty *itself* rely on undisclosed third-party APIs, though this is less common in open-source projects aiming for self-hosting.

**3. Steps to Proceed:**

1.  **Local Setup First:** Strongly recommend following the [Local Setup guide](https://twenty.com/developers/local-setup) provided in the Twenty documentation. This will help you understand how the components work together, how configuration is managed, and how the database is initialized/migrated.
2.  **Database Migration to Supabase:**
    *   Create a Supabase project.
    *   Identify the migration mechanism in `twentyhq/twenty` (check `package.json` scripts, ORM configuration, or documentation).
    *   Configure the migration tool to point to your Supabase database connection string.
    *   Run the migrations.
3.  **Backend Adaptation for Vercel:**
    *   Configure the NestJS app's database connection to use your Supabase connection string (likely via environment variables).
    *   Address the Redis/BullMQ requirement:
        *   Set up an external Redis provider (like Upstash).
        *   Configure Twenty to connect to it.
        *   Investigate how to trigger or run background jobs in your Vercel setup (Cron Jobs?). This might require code changes in Twenty.
    *   Create a `vercel.json` configuration file tailored for deploying a NestJS application. Consult Vercel documentation.
4.  **Frontend Deployment:** Configure and deploy the React frontend application (`packages/twenty-front` likely) to Vercel.
5.  **Configuration:** Use Vercel's environment variable settings to securely store database connection strings, Redis URLs, API keys (if any), and other secrets.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the deployment, focusing on database interactions, background tasks, and overall CRM functionality.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Complexity:** Adapting a system designed for traditional server/container deployment (with persistent processes for things like queue workers) to a serverless model can be complex. The Redis/BullMQ part is the main hurdle.
*   **Documentation & Community:** Check the `twentyhq/twenty` [documentation](https://twenty.com/developers), [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty/issues), and [Discord](https://discord.gg/cx5n4Jzs57) to see if others have attempted Vercel/Supabase deployments or if there's specific guidance available.
*   **Alternatives:** If the serverless adaptation proves too difficult, consider Vercel's Hobby plan (which allows longer-running processes) or alternative hosting that is more aligned with traditional Node.js/Redis applications (like container services or VMs), while still potentially using Supabase for the database.

Start with the local setup and tackling the database migration to Supabase. Then, focus on the Vercel deployment challenges, particularly Redis/BullMQ.Giselle: AI-Powered Unbiased Interview System
