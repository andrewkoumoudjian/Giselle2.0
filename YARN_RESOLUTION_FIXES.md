# Yarn Resolution Fixes for Vercel Deployment

This document explains the fixes implemented to resolve Yarn resolution and lockfile errors during Vercel deployment.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Yarn Resolution Error**

   The error `YN0082: @nx/js@npm:22.10.2: No candidates found` was occurring because Yarn couldn't resolve the plugin version. This typically happens when the Nx core version and the @nx/js plugin version are out of sync.

2. **Lockfile Error**

   The follow-on error `Internal Error: @nx/js@npm:22.10.2: This package doesn't seem to be present in your lockfile` confirmed that the lockfile wasn't updated with a valid plugin version.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced vercel-build-helper.js**

   The existing `vercel-build-helper.js` script was enhanced to:
   - Clean Yarn's npm metadata cache to avoid "No candidates found" errors
   - Check for the availability of all required Nx plugins at the correct version
   - Set up the npm registry correctly

2. **Added fix-nx-plugins.js**

   Created a new script `fix-nx-plugins.js` that:
   - Installs the @nx/js plugin at the correct version (22.10.2) using npm
   - This ensures the plugin is available during the build process

3. **Updated package.json Scripts**

   - Simplified the `preinstall` script to just run the enhanced `vercel-build-helper.js`
   - Added a new `fix-nx-plugins` script to run the fix-nx-plugins.js
   - Updated the `vercel-build` script to run the fix-nx-plugins script before building

## How This Fixes the Issue

1. **Metadata Cache Clearing**

   Clearing Yarn's npm metadata cache forces Yarn to fetch fresh registry data, which helps resolve the "No candidates found" error.

2. **Direct Plugin Installation**

   By directly installing the @nx/js plugin using npm before the build process, we ensure that the plugin is available at the correct version.

3. **Registry Configuration**

   Setting the npm registry to https://registry.npmjs.org/ ensures that Yarn can find the correct packages.

## Verifying the Fix

After deploying these changes to Vercel, the build process should complete successfully without the Yarn resolution and lockfile errors. You can verify this by checking the build logs in the Vercel dashboard.
