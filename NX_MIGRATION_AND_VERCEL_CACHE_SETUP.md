# Nx v22 Migration & Vercel Remote Caching Setup

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate your Giselle 2.5 project from Nx v20 to Nx v22 and set up Vercel remote caching to resolve the `cacheError` issues during deployment.

## Completed Changes

1. ✅ **Updated Nx Packages**
   - All `@nx/*` packages updated to version 22.10.2 in package.json
   - Added necessary packages to both dependencies and devDependencies sections

2. ✅ **Updated Task Runner Configuration**
   - Modified `nx.json` to use the new `@nx/tasks-runner/default` runner
   - Added proper remoteCache configuration options
   - Updated installation.version to 22.10.2

3. ✅ **Configured Vercel Remote Caching**
   - Added build.env configuration with Nx-specific environment variables
   - Added `@vercel/remote-nx` to the plugins section in vercel.json
   - Verified .vercel/plugins.json is correctly configured

4. ✅ **Verified TypeScript Path Aliases**
   - Confirmed tsconfig.base.json has the correct path mappings
   - Ensured @ui/* alias is properly set up

5. ✅ **Reset Nx Cache**
   - Executed `npx nx reset` to clean the local cache

## Required Steps on Vercel

Before deploying, you need to set up the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

1. **NX_VERCEL_REMOTE_CACHE_TOKEN** - Your Vercel access token for authentication
2. **NX_VERCEL_REMOTE_CACHE_TEAM** - Your Vercel team ID
3. **NX_CACHE_URL** - The URL for your remote cache (usually https://nx-cache.vercel.app)
4. **NX_REMOTE_CACHE** - Set to "true" to enable remote caching

## Required Local Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Test Local Build**
   ```bash
   yarn nx run-many --target=build --all
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**
   Commit all the changes we've made:
   - package.json (Nx v22 dependencies)
   - nx.json (updated task runner configuration)
   - vercel.json (Vercel remote caching configuration)

## Verifying Success

After deploying to Vercel, you can verify that remote caching is working correctly by:

1. Checking the build logs for messages about cache hits
2. Seeing significantly faster build times on subsequent deployments
3. Absence of the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cacheError')" error

If you still encounter issues, check:
- That all environment variables are correctly set on Vercel
- That your path aliases in the code match exactly with tsconfig.base.json
- That there are no circular dependencies in your project (use `npx nx dep-graph` to verify)

## Additional Optimization

For even faster builds, consider:
1. Adding more targets to the `cacheableOperations` array in nx.json
2. Setting appropriate TTL values for long-running operations
3. Breaking any circular dependencies between packages
